# Number Guessing Game

A Python implementation of a classic number guessing game featuring random number generation, attempt tracking, and intelligent hint system.

## Overview

This project implements a simple yet engaging number guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides helpful hints (higher/lower) and tracks the number of attempts, making it both educational and entertaining for players of all skill levels.

## Project Structure

## Game Mechanics

### Number Guessing Rules
- **Objective**: Guess the randomly generated number
- **Range**: Numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- **Hints**: Game provides "Higher" or "Lower" guidance
- **Scoring**: Attempts are counted and displayed at completion
- **Winning**: Correctly guess the number in as few attempts as possible

### Gameplay Flow
1. Computer generates a random number (1-100)
2. Player enters their guess
3. Game provides hint (Higher/Lower) if incorrect
4. Attempt counter increments
5. Process repeats until correct guess
6. Final attempt count is displayed

### Player Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear higher/lower hints
- **Progress Tracking**: Attempt counter visible during gameplay
- **Achievement Display**: Final attempt count upon completion
- **Replayability**: New random number each game

## Code Architecture

### Core Implementation

```python
# Game logic structure
n = random.randint(1, 100)  # Random number generation
guesses = 0                  # Attempt counter
while(a != n):              # Main game loop
    guesses += 1            # Increment counter
    a = int(input("Guess a number: "))  # User input
    if(a > n):              # Hint logic
        print("Low Number Please")
    else:
        print("Higher Number Please")
```

### Core Components

#### Random Number Generation
- **Range**: 1 to 100 (inclusive)
- **Method**: `random.randint()` from standard library
- **Uniqueness**: New number generated each game session

#### Input Processing
- **User Input**: Integer-based number guessing
- **Validation**: Basic integer conversion
- **Error Handling**: Simple input processing

#### Hint System
- **Higher Hint**: When guess is too high
- **Lower Hint**: When guess is too low
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time guidance for players

#### Attempt Tracking
- **Counter**: Increments with each guess
- **Display**: Shows final attempt count
- **Motivation**: Encourages efficient guessing

### Design Patterns
- **Simple Loop**: While loop for game continuation
- **State Management**: Attempt counter and game state
- **User Feedback**: Immediate response system
- **Clean Termination**: Clear end condition

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Python Command Not Found**
```bash
# Install Python from official website
# https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Or use python3 explicitly
python3 main.py
```

**Permission Denied (Linux/macOS)**
```bash
# Grant execute permissions
chmod +x main.py
```

**Input Validation Issues**
- Game expects integer input
- Non-integer inputs may cause errors
- Ensure valid number entry (1-100 range recommended)

**Game Logic Questions**
- Random number is generated once per game
- Hints are based on current guess vs. target
- Attempt counter includes the final correct guess

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Input validation for non-integer entries
- Range customization (user-defined min/max)
- Difficulty levels (different ranges)
- Statistics tracking (best scores, average attempts)
- Time-based scoring
- Multiple game sessions
- Graphical user interface

### Technical Upgrades
- Object-oriented redesign
- Database integration for high scores
