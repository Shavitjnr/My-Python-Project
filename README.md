- NewsAPI key

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 5"
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set up .env file with API keys
python main.py
```

### Project 6: Rent Calculator

**File**: `Project 6/rent_calculator.py`

A simple command-line tool to split rent and utility costs among roommates or flatmates.

**Features:**
- User-friendly prompts for all required inputs
- Calculates each person's share of rent, food, and electricity
- Simple integer division for fair splitting

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 6"
python rent_calculator.py
```

**Example:**
```
Enter your hostel/flat rent = 12000
Enter the amount of food ordered = 3000
Enter the total of electricity spend = 150
Enter the charge per unit = 8
Enter the number of persons living in room/flat = 4
Each person will pay = 4050
```

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/My-Python-Project
   ```

3. **Choose a project and run it:**
   ```bash
   # For Rock Paper Scissors
   cd "Project 1" && python Rock_Paper_Game.py
   
   # For Blackjack
   cd "Project 2" && python Cards_Game.py
   
   # For Snake Water Gun
