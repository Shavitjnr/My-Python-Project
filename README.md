- Multiple game sessions
- Professional card display

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 2"
python Cards_Game.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Get as close to 21 as possible without going over
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10
- Aces are worth 1 or 11 (automatically optimized)
- Dealer must hit on 16 and below, stand on 17 and above
- Choose 'Hit' to draw a card or 'Stand' to keep your hand

### Project 3: Snake Water Gun

**File**: `Project 3/main.py`

A Snake Water Gun game (similar to Rock Paper Scissors with different elements).

**Features:**
- High score tracking system
- Simple input-based gameplay
- Score persistence in `hiscore.txt`

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 3"
python main.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Snake beats Water
- Water beats Gun
- Gun beats Snake
- Enter 's' for Snake, 'w' for Water, 'g' for Gun

**Note**: This project appears to be incomplete and may have some issues that need fixing.

### Project 4: Number Guessing Game

**File**: `Project 4/main.py`

A number guessing game where you try to guess a random number between 1 and 100.

**Features:**
- Random number generation
- Attempt counter
- Helpful hints (higher/lower)
- Simple and addictive gameplay

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 4"
python main.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Computer generates a random number between 1-100
- Enter your guess when prompted
- Get hints whether to guess higher or lower
- Try to guess correctly in the fewest attempts

### Project 5: Jarvis Voice Assistant

**File**: `Project 5/main.py`

A sophisticated voice-controlled virtual assistant inspired by Iron Man's JARVIS.

**Features:**
- üé§ **Voice Control**: Wake word detection ("Jarvis")
- üåê **Web Automation**: Open websites with voice commands
- üéµ **Music Playback**: Voice-controlled YouTube music
- üì∞ **News Updates**: Real-time news headlines
- ü§ñ **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-powered responses
- üîä **Text-to-Speech**: Natural voice responses

**Requirements:**
