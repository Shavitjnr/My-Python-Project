## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains four Python projects that showcase different programming concepts:

- **Game Logic**: Rock Paper Scissors, Snake Water Gun, Number Guessing
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Blackjack with Card, Deck, and Hand classes
- **User Input Handling**: Input validation and error handling
- **Random Number Generation**: Computer opponents and game mechanics
- **File I/O**: High score tracking

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your local machine
2. **Ensure Python 3.x** is installed on your system
3. **Navigate** to the project directory

```bash
cd My-Python-Project
```

## üéÆ Projects

### Project 1: Rock Paper Scissors

**File**: `Project 1/Rock_Paper_Game.py`

A classic Rock Paper Scissors game where you compete against the computer.

**Features:**
- Input validation for user choices
- Random computer opponent
- Clear win/lose/tie logic
- User-friendly interface

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 1"
python Rock_Paper_Game.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock  
- Scissors beats Paper
- Enter your choice when prompted

### Project 2: Blackjack Card Game

**File**: `Project 2/Cards_Game.py`

A complete Blackjack implementation with object-oriented design.

**Features:**
- Full deck of 52 cards with suits and ranks
- Dealer AI with standard rules (hit on 16, stand on 17)
- Ace value handling (1 or 11)
- Multiple game sessions
- Professional card display

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 2"
python Cards_Game.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Get as close to 21 as possible without going over
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10
- Aces are worth 1 or 11 (automatically optimized)
- Dealer must hit on 16 and below, stand on 17 and above
- Choose 'Hit' to draw a card or 'Stand' to keep your hand

### Project 3: Snake Water Gun

**File**: `Project 3/main.py`

A Snake Water Gun game (similar to Rock Paper Scissors with different elements).

**Features:**
- High score tracking system
- Simple input-based gameplay
- Score persistence in `hiscore.txt`

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 3"
python main.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Snake beats Water
- Water beats Gun
- Gun beats Snake
- Enter 's' for Snake, 'w' for Water, 'g' for Gun

**Note**: This project appears to be incomplete and may have some issues that need fixing.

### Project 4: Number Guessing Game

**File**: `Project 4/main.py`

A number guessing game where you try to guess a random number between 1 and 100.

**Features:**
- Random number generation
- Attempt counter
- Helpful hints (higher/lower)
- Simple and addictive gameplay

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd "Project 4"
python main.py
```

**Game Rules:**
- Computer generates a random number between 1-100
- Enter your guess when prompted
- Get hints whether to guess higher or lower
- Try to guess correctly in the fewest attempts

## üìã Requirements

- **Python 3.x** (3.6 or higher recommended)
- **No external dependencies** - all projects use only Python standard library

## üéØ How to Run

### Quick Start

1. **Open terminal/command prompt**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/My-Python-Project
   ```

3. **Choose a project and run it:**
   ```bash
   # For Rock Paper Scissors
   cd "Project 1" && python Rock_Paper_Game.py
   
   # For Blackjack
   cd "Project 2" && python Cards_Game.py
   
   # For Snake Water Gun
   cd "Project 3" && python main.py
   
   # For Number Guessing
   cd "Project 4" && python main.py
   ```

### Running All Projects

You can run each project individually by navigating to its directory and executing the main Python file.

## ‚ú® Features

### Common Features Across Projects
- **Interactive gameplay** with user input
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs
- **Clear instructions** and feedback
- **Replayability** - most games can be played multiple times

### Technical Features
- **Modular code structure** (especially in Blackjack)
- **Object-oriented programming** concepts
- **File I/O operations** for score tracking
- **Random number generation** for game mechanics
- **Input validation** and user experience

## ü§ù Contributing
