# Project 7: Coin Toss Game

A simple and interactive Python game that simulates tossing a coin. The user guesses heads or tails, and the program randomly determines the outcome, keeping track of the score.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as:
- User input handling
- Random number generation
- Conditional logic
- Score tracking in a loop
- Simple command-line interface

## ✨ Features
- Simulates a fair coin toss (random heads/tails)
- User guesses the outcome each round
- Score is tracked and displayed after each toss
- Option to play multiple rounds or exit
- Clear and user-friendly prompts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- Standard library only (`random` module for randomness)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the Project 7 directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Project 7"
   ```
2. **Run the game using Python 3:**
   ```bash
   python coin_toss_game.py
   ```

3. **Follow the on-screen prompts:**
   - Enter your guess ("heads" or "tails") when prompted
   - View the result and your current score
   - Choose to play again or exit

## 📝 Example Session
```
Welcome to the Coin Toss Game!
Guess heads or tails: heads
It's heads! You guessed right.
Your score: 1
Play again? (y/n): y
Guess heads or tails: tails
It's heads! You guessed wrong.
Your score: 1
Play again? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
```

## 💡 Professional Tips
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed (`python --version`)
- Run the script from the command line for best results
- The game uses only standard Python modules—no installation required
- To stop the game at any time, press `Ctrl+C`

## 🤝 Contributing
Feel free to suggest improvements, such as:
- Adding a high score feature
- Supporting more input variations (e.g., "h"/"t")
- Adding a graphical interface with `tkinter`
