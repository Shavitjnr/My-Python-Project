# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game featuring computer opponent simulation and robust input validation.

## Overview

This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts through an interactive command-line game. Players compete against a computer opponent that makes randomized choices, with comprehensive input validation and clear game logic implementation.

## Project Structure

```
Project 1/
├── Rock_Paper_Game.py    # Main game implementation
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.6 or higher
- **Dependencies**: None (uses only Python standard library)
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system
2. Clone or download this project
3. Navigate to the Project 1 directory

## Usage

### Running the Game

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "Project 1"

# Execute the game
python Rock_Paper_Game.py
```

### Alternative Execution Methods

```bash
# Using python3 explicitly
python3 Rock_Paper_Game.py

# From parent directory
python "Project 1/Rock_Paper_Game.py"

# With executable permissions (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x Rock_Paper_Game.py
./Rock_Paper_Game.py
```

## Game Mechanics

### Rules
- **Rock** defeats **Scissors**
- **Paper** defeats **Rock**
- **Scissors** defeats **Paper**
- Identical choices result in a tie

### Gameplay Flow
1. Player enters their choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
2. Computer generates a random choice
3. Game logic determines the winner
4. Results are displayed to the player

### Input Validation
- Accepts full words: `rock`, `paper`, `scissors`
- Case-insensitive input processing
- Continuous prompting for invalid inputs
- Graceful error handling

## Code Architecture

### Core Functions

```python
def get_computer_choice():
    """Generates random computer selection from valid choices"""
    
def get_user_choice():
    """Handles user input with validation and error recovery"""
    
def determine_winner(user, computer):
    """Implements game logic to determine winner"""
    
def play_game():
    """Main game loop orchestrating the complete gameplay"""
```

### Design Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each function has a single responsibility
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling for user inputs
- **Modular Design**: Clean, maintainable code structure
- **Readable Code**: Clear variable names and logical flow

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Language | Python 3.x |
| File Size | ~1KB |
| Lines of Code | 36 |
| Dependencies | Standard library only |
| Complexity | Beginner-friendly |

## Example Session

```
Enter rock, paper, or scissors: rock
You chose: rock
Computer chose: scissors
You win!
```

## Development

### Code Quality
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error checking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs
- **Code Documentation**: Clear function purposes
- **Maintainability**: Modular, readable structure

### Best Practices Implemented
- Single responsibility principle
- Clear function naming conventions
- Consistent code formatting
- Proper use of Python standard library

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Python Command Not Found**
```bash
# Install Python from official website
# https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Or use python3 explicitly
python3 Rock_Paper_Game.py
```

**Permission Denied (Linux/macOS)**
```bash
# Grant execute permissions
chmod +x Rock_Paper_Game.py
```

**Invalid Input Loop**
- Ensure input matches exactly: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`
- Check for leading/trailing whitespace
- Verify no typos in input

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Score tracking and statistics
- Best-of-N round system
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Network multiplayer functionality
- Game history and analytics
- Configuration options
- Sound effects and animations

### Technical Upgrades
